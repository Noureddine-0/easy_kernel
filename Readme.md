# Easy_kernel

## Introduction:
Welcome to easy_kernel! This project is an ongoing exploration into the world of operating system development. While it is in its early stages, it aims to grow into a functional and educational operating system kernel.

## Goals:
- Learning: Understand the fundamentals of operating system development, including memory management, multitasking, and device interaction.
- Build a Minimalistic Kernel: Create a minimal, yet functional, kernel that demonstrates key operating system concepts.
- Experimentation: Provide a playground for experimenting with different kernel features and optimizations.

## Current Features:
- Entry point to the kernel , Main function .

## Future Roadmap:
- configure registers and add IDTs.

## Prerequisites:
- Knoweldge about computer science and operating systems architecture.

## Build and Run:
- Building the Kernel: Not that difficult to build.
- Running the Kernel:
  - Not that difficult to run.
