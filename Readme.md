Project Name

Introduction:
Welcome to easy_kernel! This project is an ongoing exploration into the world of operating system development. While it is in its early stages, it aims to grow into a functional and educational operating system kernel.

Goals:
- Learning: Understand the fundamentals of operating system development, including memory management, multitasking, and device interaction.
- Build a Minimalistic Kernel: Create a minimal, yet functional, kernel that demonstrates key operating system concepts.
- Experimentation: Provide a playground for experimenting with different kernel features and optimizations.

Current Features:
- Entry point to the kernel

Future Roadmap:
- Create the Kmain function.

Prerequisites:
- Knoweldge about computer science and operating systems architecture.

Build and Run:
- Building the Kernel: Not supported for now.
- Running the Kernel:
  - Not supported for now.
